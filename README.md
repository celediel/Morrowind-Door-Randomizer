# Morrowind Door Randomizer #

## About ##

A Morrowind MWSE-Lua mod to randomize the destinations of cell-change doors. 

I discovered that tes3.setDestination() was a thing, so I wrote this.

## Mod configuration menu ##

* Percent chance to randomize doors on activate
* Enable/Disable choosing of Wilderness cells
* Enable/Disable choosing of cells without a door to place the player at
* Choose only:
    * Interior cells
    * Exterior cells
    * Both
    * Match destination cell
* Ignore list for cells
* Debug logging, to see my cool recursive functions at work

## Requirements ##
MWSE 2.1 nightly @ [github](https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE)

## Credits ##

* MWSE Team for MWSE with Lua support
* Morrowind Modding Discord as always, for essentially being the MWSE docs
